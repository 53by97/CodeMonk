/*
 * Priority-Queues - stores elements in it on the basis of the values of its elements. A Priority Queue is based on Heaps.
 * Priority queues are used to obtain elements on the basis of some of the properties they possess. For example, 
 * a Max-Heap based Priority Queue always dequeues the maximum element present in the queue. A min-heap dequeues the minimum element present in the queue.
 * 
 * Heaps are a special type of binary trees, which stores elements on the basis of their values.
 * There are specifically two types of heaps -
 * 	Min-Heaps
 * 	Max-Heaps
 * 
 * In a max-heap, each node has greater value than any of its children. Suppose there are N jobs in a queue to be done, and each job has its own priority. 
 * The job with maximum priority will get completed first than others. At each instant, we are completing a job with maximum priority and at the same time, 
 * we are also interested in inserting a new job in the queue with its own priority. So at each instant, we have to check for the job with maximum priority 
 * to complete it and also insert if there is a new job. This task can be very easily executed using a heap by considering N jobs as N nodes of the tree.
